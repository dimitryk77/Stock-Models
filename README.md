### Forecasting Stock Prices Using LSTM and Transformer Architectures
The paper investigated the efficacy of LSTM and Transformer models in forecasting one-day ahead stock price returns. In addition, both models used the Time2Vec algorithm as a positional embedding layer. The stocks considered in the analysis were Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC), Pfizer (PFE), Proctor & Gamble (PG), and Verizon (VZ). The models used a ten-year time series from October 1, 2012, to September 30, 2022, with price, volume, and a variety of technical indicators serving as the features for each model. Training for all models used a cross-validation design with hyperparameter tuning. RMSE and MAPE were utilized to evaluate price level forecast performance. In addition, binary (up/down) signals were created from the price forecasts and assessed using accuracy and F1 scores. Study results showed no significant performance differences between the two models.
